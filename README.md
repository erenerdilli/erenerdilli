- 👋 Hi, this is Eren, I'm a human. I develop software sometimes. Emphasis on sometimes. Outside of that I do other human stuff like sleeping, eating and moving.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating. Sometimes I just talk and sometimes I actually create. But mostly talk... When I do create, it generally takes place in areas like web, mobile and game development
- 🌱 Currently learning: AWS/Azure, Elastic, React/React Native. That's one long learning curve...
- 💞️ Collaborating on mobile apps, web apps and games. If you have an idea, pitch it to me and I can talk the hell out of it. Yeah... And if I feel like it, I can write you a backend service. I hope to write you a ui too one day when above learning curve ends (doesn't look like it will end soon)
